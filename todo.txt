Figure out how to integrate update.sh into AROMA
-- The bootimage is getting flashed regardless of the "Flash boot.img" option
-- efs backup and restore would be handy to do
-- Split update.sh into two parts. Try to run the top part via AROMA to verify we're not on BML then we can continue with the rest of the installation
Add an expected kernel version check to default.prop and kernel_check.sh
-- Try to figure out a way to check if we're on GB minimum since we can flash from anything that's not Froyo
Add a check to see if we're doing a ROM upgrade (build.prop?)
-- If not, warn user that they should do a data wipe if they want to do a data backup
